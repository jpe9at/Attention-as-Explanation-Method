## XAI

(work in progress)

The aim of this project is to train a classifier on the Dataset from the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification challenge https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data and compare two XAI methods to it. 

The use of an attention module and the calculation of explanability scores based on its activaton scores as a model specific method.

The use of SHAP as a model agnostic explainer. 

The aim is to compare the two in terms of runtime, the possibility of adversarial examples, as well as variability between the assigned scores.
